        <div class="d2" id="helpful"><h1>Here are some helpful tips to get you started with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City:</h1>
            <br>
            <h2> Master the Basics:</h2>
             <ul class="lis">
                <li> Driving: Vice City's driving can be a bit wild. Take some time to get used to the car's handling, especially at high speeds. Practice turning corners and braking smoothly to avoid crashing.</li>
                <li> The aiming mechanics might take some getting used to, particularly with a mouse and keyboard. Find a sensitivity setting that feels comfortable for you. Aim for the head for quicker takedowns.</li>
                <li>Health and Armor: Keep an eye on your health bar and armor meter. Look for health and armor pickups scattered around the map, or enter safehouses (marked with a house icon) to restore them fully.</li>
             </ul>
             <br>
             <h2>Be Strategic:</h2>
                 <ul class="lis" >
                    <li> Save Often: Especially early on, save your game frequently. You can use payphones scattered around the map to create save points. This will help you avoid frustration if you die or get busted by the police.</li>
                    <li>Complete Side Missions: Don't just focus on the main story. Side missions like vigilante (police car) and ambulance missions can earn you money, health upgrades, and even weapon unlocks..</li>
                    <li>Mind the Wanted Level: The more crimes you commit, the higher your wanted level goes. The police will become more aggressive in pursuing you. If your wanted level gets too high, you'll have to evade the police or pay off your bounty at a police station..</li>
                    <li>Explore the City: Vice City is full of secrets and hidden packages to collect. Exploring can lead to fun discoveries and bonus rewards..</li>
                 </ul>
                 <br>
            <h2>Make Money Grow:</h2> 
                 <ul class="lis">
                    <li> Invest in Safehouses: Buying safehouses in different districts unlocks new save points and sometimes even garages to store your favorite vehicles.</li>

            <h1>GTA Missions</h1>
            <p id="pp2">The game includes some missions which we have to complete for completing the game.
                The game features a total of 59 story missions, but not all of them are mandatory. The requirements include 24 main storyline missions, plus the acquisition of 6 Assets and the completion of their respective missions (the 2 Print Works missions are mandatory).
                The others are optional missions, such as 13 Gang Missions and 5 Pay Phone Missions. However, all 59 missions are necessary for 100% completion of the game.</p>

        <br>    
        <div class="d3">
            <p>The game can be purchased from PlayStore and is also available on Netflix. It is all nostalgia to the good old times, you know. It's a game one can still enjoy in 2024 and it shares this incredible accolade with Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Compared to later games in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was a more refined experience. The game was a trendsetter. Hidden packages to collect and rampages to complete, two innovations. Add to that the street races and boat races to collect some extra cash, there was plenty to get stuck into after the story was done and dusted. </p>
